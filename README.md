# insertable_assistive_function_shell-lib

## An assisting library for building THE major scripts

In slightly more detail:
- Bash functions that should be easily insert-able (or source-able even) into various scripts. 
- Their behaviour should be modifiable only by input (or mostly).
- Some QoL functions included.
